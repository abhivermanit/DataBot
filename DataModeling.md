## SmartDraw tool used to data model

- Work with all the business teams, and their core operational business
- We design and deliver solutions building the data models from scratch
- translate business requirements into data pipelines
##
- design a data model for AirBnB
- pupropse of this data
- transactional or analytical
- analytical purposes for data warehousing

##
- schema -- star schema -- denormalized -- operations faster -- not optimal for storage
- snowflake schema -- normalized data -- reduces redundancy -- but uses more joins -- better for storage

## objectives to data model on 
- reviews to improve experience
- business profitablity -- pricing, revenue, optimization



## approach
- analytical purposes we will choose star schema
- what data to capture

  tables -- 1. review fact

  - review id (primary key)
  - listing id
  - name
 
  - 2. listing dim table (primary key)
       - 
- 3. user table
     - user_id (primary key)
    
- make multiple dimension and attribute tables



Explanation :- 

--------+
                 |    Date Dimension   |
                 |---------------------|
                 | Date, Month, Year   |
                 +---------------------+
                           |
                           |
+----------------+   +----------------+   +----------------+
| Driver Dim     |   |   Orders Fact   |   | Customer Dim   |
|----------------|<->|----------------|<->|----------------|
| Name           |   | Revenue        |   | Name           |
| Age            |   | Delivery Time  |   | City           |
| City           |   | Order Count    |   | Segment        |
| Rating         |   +----------------+   +----------------+

( The fact table is the center of the cube, connected to multiple dimensions )

Imagine I work for a food delivery app. In our OLAP cube, the Orders Fact table holds the actual measures like total revenue and delivery time. We surround this with dimensions like Driver, Customer, and Date. 
Each dimension has attributes â€” for example, the Driver dimension has Name, Age, City, and Rating. These attributes allow us to slice and dice the fact data.
For instance, I can analyze average delivery time by driver age group, or total revenue by customer city, or monthly delivery performance.

Each attribute actually maps to a property of the entity from the operational system. In other words, if the driver class in our backend has a property called City, 
it will become the City attribute inside the OLAP dimension. This is how OLAP cubes structure data for fast and flexible reporting.


Types of schemas :-

There are three main types of schemas commonly used in data warehouses: Star Schema, Snowflake Schema, and Galaxy Schema.

Dimensions - that provide context to facts (measurable business events).

Attributes - Each dimension has attributes that provide more details. 

Measures - Quantifiable (numerical values) Business Data 


Example case study :- UBER Ride App 

Fact Table = Foreign Keys from Dimensions + Metrics (measurable data).

Dimension Table = Descriptive attributes that provide context.
