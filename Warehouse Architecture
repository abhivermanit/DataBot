In Snowflake:
A Warehouse is NOT a data storage warehouse.
A Warehouse is just a virtual compute engine.

When you do:

USE WAREHOUSE MAPS_DATA_KH_MAINTENANCE_OPS_04_VWH; 

This just tells Snowflake:

"Hey, use this virtual cluster to process my queries, calculations, and transformations."

But the actual data is stored in:

MAPS_DATA_SEMANTIC_DB.KH_MAINTENANCE_OPS
